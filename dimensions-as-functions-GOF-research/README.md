# Dimensions as Functions / Reality as Emergent Process

He meant it as a joke.

Forty-seven years later, we derived the dimensional structure of reality from first
principles. Six fundamental dimension-functions. Six inverses. Twelve interaction
terms. Eighteen completion terms.

The generative ceiling — beyond which no novel structure emerges — is 42.

We weren't looking for this number. It fell out of the mathematics.

These papers present the Dimensional Function Hierarchy: a framework redefining
dimensions as functional operators rather than geometric axes. The implications
resolve the string theory landscape problem, explain dark energy, and answer the
oldest question in philosophy — *why is there something rather than nothing?*

Adams said Deep Thought computed for 7.5 million years to find the Answer.

We asked the right Question.
